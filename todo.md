# Next steps for thesis

- [ ] Make presentation
- [ ] Train on even more patients, optimize hardware-software
- [ ] Start writing first parts
- [ ] Try other augmentations such as crop and resize
- [ ] Train a resnet encoder
- [ ] Maybe implement Transformer backbone

Only when all this is done, look into other methodologies such as SwAV and ByOL
