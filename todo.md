# Next steps for thesis

## 1) SimCLR framework
- [ ] Clean the project
- [ ] Make it easier to train and test --> Improve workflow
- [ ] Make it possible to log more metrics, make this modular!
- [ ] Test more augmentations, try to separate the classes more
- [ ] Look into hyperparameters: tau, settings of augmentations
- [ ] Do an ablation study of the augmentations

## 2) Implement SleepTransformer
- [ ] Try to reproduce supervised results
- [ ] Then think about different ways to do contrastive learning within this framework

Only when all this is done, look into other methodologies such as SwAV and ByOL
